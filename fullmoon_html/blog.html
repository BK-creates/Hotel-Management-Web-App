            <h2 >Introduction:</h2>
            <div class="fakeimg" style="height:220px;">FullMoon is a simple luxury of a boutique hotel in TamilNadu, Chennai. The Hotel FullMoon uses
                full-width images to display the elegant furnishings and setting of the hotel. Also, the 
                booking form is front and center so that visitors can immediately check availability.
                                
                All of the warm tones in the slideshow images complement the warm golden hotel logo, and many 
                of the images reflect the curling script with their own flowing curves. The website uses white 
                space strategically to guide the visitor’s eye towards the name of the hotel and its five-star rating.
                
                For a certain target audience, the images guests capture and share on social media will be almost as 
                important as their stay at the hotel. The Hotel d’Angleterre website highlights stunning images shared 
                by guests on social media in an Instagram-friendly grid, while also inviting visitors to connect with 
                the hotel on its social media channels. This provides guests a way to anticipate their stay, share their 
                great experience, and convince others to book a stay at the hotel.Rather than setting up a social media 
                feed on your site and calling it a day, consider curating images that reflect your brand and the goals for 
                your website. You don’t want to be caught off guard when a guest shares an image of their half-eaten room service pizza.
