# Hotel-Management-Web-App

The project involves creating a website for a particular hotel. Customers can book tables and
rooms and order food through the online ordering system. The online food ordering system
sets up a food menu online and customers can easily place the order as per customers
like.Also with a food menu. The Restaurant management systems motivates us to develop
the system. There are various facilities provided so that the users of the system will get
service effectively. Also, the system considers Restaurants as well as Mess facility to the
customers. Again, the idea comes that mostly mess users are person who are shifted for
various reason in new cities. So, users are interrelated. Increasing use of smart phones is also
considered as a motivation, so that any users of this system get all service on single click.
Due to lack of a full fledge application that can full fill the customer requirements by
providing him food from restaurants as well as from mess service, there is a need for the
system. This proposed system will be used by the people who keep shifting from cities to
cites. As well as, it will be useful for the students studying in different cities. This project
would provide the users not only to view the menu but also help them to book rooms in
hotel if their the people who keep shifting from cities to cites.
