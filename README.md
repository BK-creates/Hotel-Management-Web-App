# Hotel-Management-Web-App

The project involves creating a website for a particular hotel. Customers can book tables and
rooms and order food through the online ordering system. The online food ordering system
sets up a food menu online and customers can easily place the order as per customers
like. Also with a food menu. The Restaurant management system motivates us to develop
the system. There are various facilities provided so that the users of the system will get
service effectively. Also, the system considers Restaurants as well as Mess facilities for the
customers. Again, the idea comes that most mess users are people who have shifted for
various reasons to new cities. So, users are interrelated. Increasing the use of smartphones is also
considered as motivation so that any users of this system get all services on a  single click.
Due to the lack of a full-fledged application that can fulfill the customer's requirements by
providing him food from restaurants as well as from mess service, there is a need for the
system. This proposed system will be used by the people who keep shifting from cities to
cities. As well as it will also be useful for students studying in different cities. This project
would provide the users not only to view the menu but also help them to book rooms in
hotels if they're people who keep shifting from city to city.
